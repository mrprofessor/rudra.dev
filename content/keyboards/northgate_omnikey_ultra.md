## History {#history}

Northgate Computer Systems was founded in 1987, and they used to sell
personal computers. They sold their products through direct marketing.
However, their Omnikey keyboards were sold through dealers. Before the
introduction of Omnikey series keyboards, Northgate badged keyboards from
several companies such as Focus and Monterey, and some of the initial
Omnikey models are said to be manufactured by Focus.

The first generation of Omnikey models was sold in the late ’88s, and the
Omnikey Ultra series was manufactured in the mid-’90s. Here are some
advertisements for Omnikey Ultra boards.

These Omnikey keyboards were widely praised for their reliability and key
feel. After they ceased their computer production, they kept on marketing
and selling their keyboard until Avant took over. Many users preferred
using the Omnikey keyboard instead of the original boards that came with
their computer. These boards were compatible with both IBM and Apple
computers.

## Build &amp; Features {#build-features}

This keyboard uses a hard plastic top, and that’s all the plastic you get
on the board(except the switches and caps). It uses a steel switch-plate
and a steel back-plate. It weighs around 2.3 kg, which isn’t surprising
given so much of metal it has. This board is built like a tank and is one
of the toughest Alps boards I own.

Opening this board is very straightforward; It has 6 screws in the back
and 4 more on the switch plate. The back panel is quite heavy and weighs
around 800 grams. On the back, there are multiple stickers, One with FCC
id, one with the serial number, and there is another sticker with some
numbers I couldn’t make any sense of. The feet are rubber coated for
better friction, and there are two sturdy rubber pads on the bottom.

Like most Omnikeys, this board came with Alps complicated pine white
switches (Alps SKCL whites). The caps are Doubleshot ABS ones, and some of
the modifier switches have different colors. It features a BAE (Big Ass
Enter), left side Function row, and a navigation cluster with cross-arrow
keys. The alphas + modifier layout is very similar to the Monterey layout
with a Big ass enter and a full-sized backspace.

The PCB is connected to the controller via a white ribbon cable. This PCB
supports N-key rollover and various layouts including but not limited to
Dvorak, Amiga, and Qwerty. The controller also features a set of
DIP(Dual-in-line package) switches, which can be configured to set
layouts, swap modifier keys, and change protocols.

## Restoration {#restoration01}

The keyboard wasn’t in a good state when I acquired it. It needed some cleaning and some retr0briting to bring it back to its original condition. I have greased the stabilizers with di-electric grease to reduce the rattle; However, the switches could use some cleaning. This keyboard is by far the most practical vintage keyboard I have ever owned, and I intend to keep using it in the coming years.
