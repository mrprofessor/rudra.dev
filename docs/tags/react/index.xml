      <description>Table of Contents Syntax Highlighting Linters and Formatters Autocompletion Commenting Conclusion It&amp;rsquo;s been 8 months since I have been using (neo)vim as my primary text editor. Initially it was incredibly tough to adopt and use it in work. Well that would be another story to tell.&#xA;Back then I was working mostly in backend using CoffeeScript (I know 🙈). VS Code had a little support for CoffeeScript so I didn&amp;rsquo;t had any problems using vim full time.</description>
