This is the first vintage keyboard I have acquired. Unfortunately, it was broken
into pieces on its way to me from Florida. However, with a bit of tender love and
care, it was up and running in a few hours.

I don't know the exact manufacturing date of the board, but there is a sticker
that says it was repaired in 1989. Most IBM 5150 keyboards were manufactured
before 1984, So it is at least 37 years old in 2021.

I got a Soarer's converter along with this keyboard. With a bit of remapping, I
was able to replace it with my Drop CTRL as my new daily driver.

*** History

:CUSTOM_ID: history
:END:

This keyboard is a reproduction of one of the original IBM model F 4704 series
keyboards. Originally it came with the =IBM 4704 FINANCE COMMUNICATION DISPLAY
STATION MODEL 1 ENHANCED= and mainly used by the banking industry. In 2012, it
was first documented by a Canadian computer enthusiast who goes by the name
[[http://kishy.ca/][Kishy]] and hence called the =Kishsaver=.


In 2015, Joe Strandberg aka =Ellipse= has decided to make [[https://deskthority.net/viewtopic.php?t=11046][reproductions]] of the F62
and F77 models. After a long wait of almost 4 years, in 2020 the project started
shipping the boards for the pre-orders.

Though it's a reproduction, it isn't an replica of the F 4704. It lacks a beeper,
stand, beeper volume knob, and stepped caps.

*** Acquisition & Details
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: acquisition-details
:END:

Like most other IBM enthusiasts, I too entered into Ellipse's group buy. But I
was too anxious to wait two years to get my hands on one, So I got this board
from r/mechmarket for a much lower price. Initially, I had planned to repaint
the keyboard to beige, but I didn't go through it. In real life, this red looks
quite beautiful.

I got the 609th model, and the sticker on the back says the date of manufacture.
It was made in China, unlike the original model.

It came with blank beige keycaps, and the seller had included a set of blank
Mopar blue keycaps. I swapped those beige caps with [[https://www.pckeyboard.com/][Unicomp]] APL caps with orange
sub legends, and they look pretty impressive. However, some of the switches feel
scratchier with the Unicomp cap, but I can't figure out why.

My favorite part of the keyboard is its case. The case is built with Zinc and is
pretty heavy. The powder coating on this particular model is superb, but I have
heard complaints from other buyers regarding the quality.

The board uses Model F AT-style barrels and barrel plates. The spring felt a bit
lighter than my other Model F boards, but it wasn't too different. The spacebar
uses model M type stabilizers, and it used to rattle a lot. I had to bend the
stabilizer tabs a little bit and apply some silicone grease to reduce the rattle.

The assembly backplate is heat-treated and has a rainbow effect like the IBM
Model F keyboards.

This board uses a compact version of the Xwhatsit controller([[https://deskthority.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=13479][designed by wcass]]),
and I was lucky enough to get the USB-C version. Ellipse made both type-C and
micro-USB controllers, and unfortunately, the buyers don't get the option to
choose. The soldering job on my model wasn't up to the mark, and I got some
unwanted key actuation. I had to clean the excess flux and tape the pins so that
they won't touch the metal case.

*** Verdict
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: verdict
:END:

It is pretty rare to find boards that are built as tough as this F62 and still
offer a unique typing experience. I wouldn't recommend this board to a
non-hobbyist because of its complexities. That said, I have been daily driving
this keyboard for the past six months, and it's one of the most practical ones
in my collection.

At the time of writting, this old beamer is the prize of my collection. I have
acquired this from a DT member who let it go for a fair enough price. They were
kind enough to send me an metal(iron) door with the board too.

Initially, I liked the battered look of the board, but after a while, I powder
coated it to black. I couldn't find an "olive-green" or "matte-black" color,
So I settled for Glossy black. It looked quite good in person but shines a lot
on camera.

The board wasn't in a terrible condition when I got it. The foam had turned
into sticky goo, which needed some cleaning up. I manually cut a craft store
foam and replaced it.

I got [[https://github.com/purdeaandrei/CompactBeamSpring][Pandrew's version of the Xwhatsit controller]] to replace the original
controller. I got Pandrew's solenoid driver too, and after a bit of hacking
around with QMK, I got it working.

There are some corrosions on the plate but I was told that they won't grow, so
I didn't bother. There was a bit of rust on the switch springs, so I tried to
take apart the switches to clean them but found them hard to disassemble and
ultimately gave up. The rust doesn't affect the smoothness of the switches.

I used the board for a week as my daily driver with the solenoid on. I wasn't
very impressed with the heavy space bar as it tired my thumb after every 15
minutes. Apart from that, this board is an absolute joy to have and is
a thing of beauty.

I love this board, and hopefully, it will be on my secondary machine for years
to come, but right now, I will get back to my beloved [[/keyboards/ibm_model_f_at/][F AT]] and get some work
done.

This keyboard originally came with IBM Personal Computer AT (PC/AT). This
computer was released in 1984, and IBM has produced over 100,000 units before
discontinuing them in 1987. Some sources say that the *AT* stands for *Advanced Technology*.

This model was a successor to the very famous and now weird XT layout. The IBM PS/2 (Personal System/2) was the successor to the IBM PC/AT, and with it came the venerable model M keyboard. The model M keyboard introduced the very layout that is being used worldwide even today.

*** Acquisition & Restoration

I have acquired this keyboard from eBay for a fair price. It was super dirty and was full of gunk. The barrel plate has rusty, and there were a bunch of dead spiders inside. The keycaps were quite filthy too.

I removed the caps and barrels and washed them in warm soapy water. Then scrubbed the barrel plate but couldn't repaint it because I ran out of spray paints by then. Replaced the rotten foam with a hand-made 2mm one, and reassembled everything.

It was an absolute joy to use the keyboard on modern machines. It uses AT protocol, So using a passive AT to PS/2 converter would do the trick. Since I don't own a computer with a native PS/2 port, I daisy-chained an active PS/2 to USB (A) converter and then another Type A to Type C adapter to connect my Macbook Pro.

This board was manufactured by a Czechoslovakian company called [[http://www.zbrojovka-brno.cz/][Zbrojovka Brno]]

later typewriters and computers.

This board was made in 1988, and it uses the Soviet-era [[https://www.tesla.cz/en/][Tesla]] hall effect
switches.

The case and keycaps were quite good; however, the plate was rusty, and some of
the switches were scratchy.  It took a good bit of force to take apart the
switches from the plate too. Unfortunately, during that process, I scuffed a
couple of switch stems.

I have planned to lube the switches and swap the rusty springs with the Cherry

with Apple professional desktops starting with the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_IIsi][Macintosh IIsi]].

These boards use either Alps or Mitsumi switches. The Mitsumi switches were only
used on boards made in Japan. M3501s are said to be the last
"Mechanical Keyboards" that apple has ever made.

I got this German layout M3501 from the Deskthority sale listing for a fair price.

It has thick PBT dye-sublimated keycaps with =Univers 57 Oblique= font, and It uses
the Alps dampened cream switches. However, the spacebar is made of ABS and hence
it's yellowed.

The case is also made of ABS, and it had been significantly yellowed when I
acquired it. The case design is wavy, and I found it quite ergonomic without the
feet extended.

The =Caps Lock= uses an Alps latching switch, which physically locks down when

RT-8700 is a series of full-sized keyboards manufactured by NMB in the mid-’90s.
They came with the fifth generation Hi-Tek series 725 switches, which is the
last generation of its type.

Unlike the 4th generation boards, these have a smaller footprint and thinner
bezels. Here is the original Ad for these boards.

shipped them out all over the world.

Initially, I wasn't aware of this, but I got an entry when another buyer had to
drop out of the deal for some reason. I got '10' boards for myself and helped
proxy some more for the local keyboard enthusiasts.

The case is probably made of thin ABS and it's very poorly made. The whole thing
creaks a lot, even with a minor flex. The keycaps however, are made of thick PBT
with dye sublimated legends.

This particular model has clicky Hi-Tek series 725 switches(black). These
switches are colloquially known as =space invader= switches due to their
resemblance with the 8-bit space invader arcade game characters.

The switches feel a bit stiffer and aren’t as smooth as the white space invader

Northgate Computer Systems was founded in 1987, and they used to sell
personal computers. They sold their products through direct marketing.
However, their Omnikey keyboards were sold through dealers. Before the
introduction of Omnikey series keyboards, Northgate badged keyboards from
several companies such as Focus and Monterey, and some of the initial
Omnikey models are said to be manufactured by Focus.

The first generation of Omnikey models was sold in the late ’88s, and the
Omnikey Ultra series was manufactured in the mid-’90s. Here are some
advertisements for Omnikey Ultra boards.

These Omnikey keyboards were widely praised for their reliability and key
feel. After they ceased their computer production, they kept on marketing
and selling their keyboard until Avant took over. Many users preferred
using the Omnikey keyboard instead of the original boards that came with
their computer. These boards were compatible with both IBM and Apple
computers.

*** Build & Features

This keyboard uses a hard plastic top, and that’s all the plastic you get
on the board(except the switches and caps). It uses a steel switch-plate
and a steel back-plate. It weighs around 2.3 kg, which isn’t surprising
given so much of metal it has. This board is built like a tank and is one
of the toughest Alps boards I own.

Opening this board is very straightforward; It has 6 screws in the back
and 4 more on the switch plate. The back panel is quite heavy and weighs
around 800 grams. On the back, there are multiple stickers, One with FCC
id, one with the serial number, and there is another sticker with some
numbers I couldn’t make any sense of. The feet are rubber coated for
better friction, and there are two sturdy rubber pads on the bottom.

Like most Omnikeys, this board came with Alps complicated pine white
switches (Alps SKCL whites). The caps are Doubleshot ABS ones, and some of
the modifier switches have different colors. It features a BAE (Big Ass
Enter), left side Function row, and a navigation cluster with cross-arrow
keys. The alphas + modifier layout is very similar to the Monterey layout
with a Big ass enter and a full-sized backspace.

The PCB is connected to the controller via a white ribbon cable. This PCB
supports N-key rollover and various layouts including but not limited to
Dvorak, Amiga, and Qwerty. The controller also features a set of
DIP(Dual-in-line package) switches, which can be configured to set
layouts, swap modifier keys, and change protocols.

The keyboard wasn’t in a good state when I acquired it. It needed some cleaning and some retr0briting to bring it back to its original condition.

This keyboard is by far the most practical vintage keyboard I have ever owned, and I intend to keep using it in the coming years.

I am not sure what the keycaps are made of, probably PBT, but the legends
are sharp and beautiful. These legends are created using an unidentified
method, which was previously misidentified as being dye sublimated. The
keycaps are alps compatible and have a chalky matte finish. This
particular board has a Spanish layout.

The switches feel very crispy and nice to type on. They don’t sound too
loud unlike blue and white alps, rather a bit muted.

The keyboard membrane is supported by a thick steel plate screwed to the
switch plate.

The earliest appearance of the board was around 1983. In western markets,
the IBM 4704 terminal came bundled with a 107-key Capacitive buckling
spring keyboard. In Asian markets, it used to be sold with an Alps
corporation-made keyboard with Chinese or Japanese legends. This model is
a Chinese variant, and it was primarily sold in the Chinese market.

This board got attention among the vintage community when one person
started selling a bunch of these NOS boards for cheap. They first sold
the Japanese ones and then the Chinese. I believe this board came from
that stock.

the lowest weight among other SKCC switches, around 60 grams of force.

The whole board has only one wire stabilizer, You guessed it right, it is
the Spacebar. Other larger caps such as =Shift= and bottom =Enter= have
stabilizer inserts instead of a wire stabilizer.

The back of the PCB was covered by a layer of unknown material probably
aluminum, I couldn’t say for sure.

This board comes with a beeper/speaker that beeps every time a switch is
actuated, I find it immensely interesting and funny. I doubt whether my
co-workers would appreciate such a feature. The speaker is mounted on a
speaker grill on the bottom case.

Another interesting feature is that the board has a scroll wheel to
adjust the volume, and it gets quite loud when turned up 100%. The
speaker produces a white static noise that is barely noticeable.

*** Conversion
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: conversion
:END:

Luckily the previous owner of the board included a [[https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=72052.0][Hasu]] converter with
the package. However, they forgot to declare it in the customs invoice
while shipping, and that led to a 30 days customs holdup and 50$ fine.

The converter was already flashed and worked when I plugged it in. I used
TMK(Written by Hasu) to reprogram it to a more personally layout. Here
are the [[https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard/tree/master/converter/ibm4704_usb][instructions]] I followed to reprogram it.

:END:

*** History
Dell AT102W is one of the mass-produced Alps Bigfoot series keyboards
made in the late 90s. Dell used to ship them with their personal
computers. The early Dell keyboards, such as Dell AT 101 were made by
Alps Electric, but the later models like this one were made by Silitek.

#+END_EXPORT

The board has Alps SKCM Black switches, which are in pristine condition.
These are light tactile switches, and I like these more than Oranges
and Salmons.

The keycaps are ABS and laser etched, some of these are slightly yellowed.

Like the Pingmaster, the back of the PCB is protected by an aluminium(?)
sheet.

Opening the keyboard seemed fairly easy with 6 screws and 4 plastic tabs,
but I broke one of the tabs while reassembling it.

*** Restoration
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: restoration02
:END:

I don't have any plans to restore the keyboard, AT101W/AT102W boards
are found plenty in the wild. I might harvest the switches to use them in
a modern build in the future.

*** Conclusion
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: conclusion
:END:

I believe the AT102W case is one of the best-sounding alps cases available.
I particularly like the light tactility of the SKCM black switches, which
makes the board quite enjoyable.
