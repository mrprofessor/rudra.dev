## History {#history}

This keyboard was made by Acer and it uses Acer’s patented
switch-over-membrane design. Acer had produced various models in this
series, and this particular model is for Data general.

## Build and Features {#build-and-features}

I have acquired this New old stock keyboard from eBay for a very
reasonable price. The keyboard isn’t too heavy despite its large footprint.
However, the board is built very well and doesn’t creak, unlike other
cheap boards.

I am not sure what the keycaps are made of, probably PBT, but the legends
are sharp and beautiful. These legends are created using an unidentified
method, which was previously misidentified as being dye sublimated. The
keycaps are alps compatible and have a chalky matte finish. This
particular board has a Spanish layout.

The switches feel very crispy and nice to type on. They don’t sound too
loud unlike blue and white alps, rather a bit muted.

The keyboard membrane is supported by a thick steel plate screwed to the
switch plate.

The switches are contact based, and they sit on a membrane. Upon pressing
the switch, the hammer contacts the membrane, and it actuates.

Upon removing the membrane, we could see the switches fitted to the switch plate.

## Verdict {#verdict}

At the time of writing, this board is one the favourites in my collection.
I love the switch-travel, the case acoustics, quality keycaps and
those huge bezels.
