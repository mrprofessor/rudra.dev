This is the first vintage keyboard I have acquired. Unfortunately, it was broken
into pieces on its way to me from Florida. However, with a bit of tender love and
care, it was up and running in a few hours.

I don't know the exact manufacturing date of the board, but there is a sticker
that says it was repaired in 1989. Most IBM 5150 keyboards were manufactured
before 1984, So it is at least 37 years old in 2021.

I got a Soarer's converter along with this keyboard. With a bit of remapping, I
was able to replace it with my Drop CTRL as my new daily driver.
