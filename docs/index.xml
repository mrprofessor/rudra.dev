      <description>At the time of writting, this old beamer is the prize of my collection. I have acquired this from a DT member who let it go for a fair enough price. They were kind enough to send me an metal(iron) door with the board too.&#xA;Initially, I liked the battered look of the board, but after a while, I powder coated it to black. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find an &amp;ldquo;olive-green&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;matte-black&amp;rdquo; color, So I settled for Glossy black.</description>

      <description>This is the first vintage keyboard I have acquired. Unfortunately, it was broken into pieces on its way to me from Florida. However, with a bit of tender love and care, it was up and running in a few hours.&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t know the exact manufacturing date of the board, but there is a sticker that says it was repaired in 1989. Most IBM 5150 keyboards were manufactured before 1984, So it is at least 37 years old in 2021.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents Let&amp;rsquo;s go hacking Monitoring events Conclusion The first thing that comes to mind when considering a task scheduler is a CRON job. As most of today&amp;rsquo;s servers are hosted on Linux machines, setting a cron job for a periodic task might seem like a good option for many. However, in production, having a crontab can be nothing but a pain. It can be tricky to configure different time zones depending on the location of the server.</description>

      <description>I love working in terminal and editing with (Neo)vim. Though I have been using vim since my college days, for past two years I am using it as my full-time editor.&#xA;I remember vividly when I first switched to vim at work. It was a horrible experience for the first week which made me flood my vimrc file with plugins to make it work. I have definitely moved past that phase and learned to grok vi since then.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents Using Proxy with NPM For people who work in a company and squeez out some of their time to learn nodejs, setting up an dev-environment can be a real pain.
