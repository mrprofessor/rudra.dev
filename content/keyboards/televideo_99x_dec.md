## History {#history}

This keyboard was manufactured by [NMB](https://www.nmbtc.com/) in the early '90s for Televideo terminals.
This particular board was made for the Televideo 99X series of terminals. This
layout is known as DEC layout, named after [Digital Equipment Corporation](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation) and
uses a different protocol to communicate with the Terminals.


## Acquisition {#acquisition}

I was lucky enough to get into the [largest vintage computer keyboard](https://deskthority.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=25763) group-buy
in history. [Inoznez](https://deskthority.net/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=21126), used his parent's farm to store the boards and slowly
shipped them out all over the world.

Initially, I wasn't aware of this, but I got an entry when another buyer had to
drop out of the deal for some reason. I got 10 boards for myself and helped proxy
some more for the local keyboard enthusiasts.

There were many layouts, such as German, Swedish, Spanish, etc and I got one
from each. This board is the one with a Swedish layout.

These boards are NOS(New Old Stock) which means they have never been used and
are from old production. I haven't removed the plastic cover from the coiled
cable yet. :)

## Build and Features {#build-and-features}

The case is made of ABS and will yellow over time; However, these boards are NOS,
and these haven't been yellowed yet.

It uses 5th generation NMB Hi-Tek switches, colloquially known as space invader
switches ðŸ‘¾ . This board has two-eyed linear ones, and they feel pretty smooth
and have a thockier sound. Even though I usually don't like linear switches, It
is an absolute joy typing on them.

The keycaps are thick PBT keycaps with dye-sublimated legends. The keycaps have
their respective rows written on the internals.

It has two screws and "8" clips on the back that keep the board together. I was
too afraid to break a clip, so I didn't open it. There wasn't any Televideo or
NMB branding anywhere on the case.

## Restoration {#restoration}

Since this is a NOS board, it didn't require any restoration. However, I need
make a converter for it. Thanks to the genious of [Purdea Andrei](https://github.com/purdeaandrei) , TMK now
[supports](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard/pull/711) the Televideo 990/995 space invader boards.
