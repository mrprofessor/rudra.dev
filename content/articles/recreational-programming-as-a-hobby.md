## Abstract {#abstract}

For a long period of time, there existed a small group of people who
wouldn't program for a living, rather program to either solve problems
or just have fun. I was lucky enough to have a job that lets me write
programs for money, and over the time it grayed the line between
programming for fun vs programming for money.
