## History {#history}

This board was manufactured by a Czechoslovakian company called [Zbrojovka Brno](http://www.zbrojovka-brno.cz/)
in the late '80s. Zbrojovka Brno manufactured small arms, motor vehicles, and
later typewriters and computers.

This board was made in 1988, and it uses the Soviet-era [Tesla](https://www.tesla.cz/en/) hall effect
switches.

## Acquisition &amp; Restoration {#acquisition-restoration}

It had been up for sale for more than a year on [r/mechmarket](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/), and I was lucky
enough to snag it for a very fair price.  It took exactly a month to reach
India from Czechia, and it did survive the trip.

The case and keycaps were quite good; however, the plate was rusty, and some of
the switches were scratchy.  It took a good bit of force to take apart the
switches from the plate too. Unfortunately, during that process, I scuffed a
couple of switch stems.

I have planned to lube the switches and swap the rusty springs with the Cherry
ones. The plate needs to be sanded and repainted. This board uses a DB25
connector, so I need to find the pin layouts and make a converter for it.
