## History {#history}

RT-8700 is a series of full-sized keyboards manufactured by NMB in the mid-’90s.
They came with the fifth generation Hi-Tek series 725 switches, which is the
last generation of its type.

Unlike the 4th generation boards, these have a smaller footprint and thinner
bezels. Here is the original Ad for these boards.

NMB used to market them as the “Right Touch” keyboard, and these were the
alternatives of the venerable IBM Model M and Northgate Omnikey 101s, among
others.

## Acquisition {#acquisition}

I was lucky enough to get into the [largest vintage computer keyboard](https://deskthority.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=25763) group-buy
in history. [Inoznez](https://deskthority.net/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=21126) used his parent's farm to store the boards and slowly
shipped them out all over the world.

Initially, I wasn't aware of this, but I got an entry when another buyer had to
drop out of the deal for some reason. I got '10' boards for myself and helped
proxy some more for the local keyboard enthusiasts.

There were many layouts, such as German, Swedish, Norwegian, etc and I got one
from each. This board is the one with a Danish layout.


## Build and Features {#build-and-features}

The case is probably made of thin ABS and it's very poorly made. The whole thing
creaks a lot, even with a minor flex. The keycaps however, are made of thick PBT
with dye sublimated legends.

This particular model has clicky Hi-Tek series 725 switches(black). These
switches are colloquially known as `space invader` switches due to their
resemblance with the 8-bit space invader arcade game characters.

The switches feel a bit stiffer and aren’t as smooth as the white space invader
switches I got a few weeks back.

I got 6 of these boards, and I have planned to harvest the switches and caps from
one keyboard and build a custom 60% board using the PCB and Plates from the
latest group buy.


## Restoration {#restoration}

These boards didn't need any restoration, because they are practically new. I
got an active PS/2 port to USB converter, and it worked with my computer.
