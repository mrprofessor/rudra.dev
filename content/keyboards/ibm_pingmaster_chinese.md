## History {#history}

IBM 4704 administrative keyboard a.k.a the Pingmaster is one of the most
iconic vintage keyboards out there. After chasing it for over a year, I
finally managed to acquire one.

The earliest appearance of the board was around 1983. In western markets,
the IBM 4704 terminal came bundled with a 107-key Capacitive buckling
spring keyboard. In Asian markets, it used to be sold with an Alps
corporation-made keyboard with Chinese or Japanese legends. This model is
a Chinese variant, and it was primarily sold in the Chinese market.

This board got attention among the vintage community when one person
started selling a bunch of these NOS boards for cheap. They first sold
the Japanese ones and then the Chinese. I believe this board came from
that stock.

## Build and features {#build-and-features}

The keyboard body is made of Plastic with a really nice grainy texture.
It has thick Doubleshot ABS keycaps and a bunch of relegendables.

This keyboard has Alps SKCC green switches. These switches are infamous
for being quite pingy, &amp; hence the name “Pingmaster”. Alps SKCC green has
the lowest weight among other SKCC switches, around 60 grams of force.

The board has exactly 33 relegendable keycaps, and the Numpad is in the
middle section instead of being on the right. However, I switched that to
have a more modern look.

The whole board has only one wire stabilizer, You guessed it right, it is
the Spacebar. Other larger caps such as `Shift` and bottom `Enter` have
stabilizer inserts instead of a wire stabilizer.

The back of the PCB was covered by a layer of unknown material probably
aluminum, I couldn’t say for sure.

This board comes with a beeper/speaker that beeps every time a switch is
actuated, I find it immensely interesting and funny. I doubt whether my
co-workers would appreciate such a feature. The speaker is mounted on a
speaker grill on the bottom case.

Another interesting feature is that the board has a scroll wheel to
adjust the volume, and it gets quite loud when turned up 100%. The
speaker produces a white static noise that is barely noticeable.


## Conversion {#conversion}

Luckily the previous owner of the board included a [Hasu](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=72052.0) converter with
the package. However, they forgot to declare it in the customs invoice
while shipping, and that led to a 30 days customs holdup and 50$ fine.

The converter was already flashed and worked when I plugged it in. I used
TMK(Written by Hasu) to reprogram it to a more personally layout. Here
are the [instructions](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard/tree/master/converter/ibm4704_usb) I followed to reprogram it.

## Epilogue {#epilogue}

This is one of my toughest acquisitions so far, and I couldn’t be happier.
The keyboard delivers and is one of the finest boards I have in my
collection.
