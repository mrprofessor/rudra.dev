      <description>Table of Contents General configuration Keybindings Customize Status Bar Customize Active Pane Miscellaneous Who wants a minimal config anyway! General configuration We need to create a ~/.tmux.conf file in our home directory. This will be the configuration file for our setup.&#xA;If the underlying terminal emulator has XTERM-256 support then we can add 256 colors support to tmux.&#xA;set -g default-terminal &amp;#34;tmux-256color&amp;#34; By default tmux windows start with number 0.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents 1. Get the table data as JSON objects 2. Get the table data with specific columns 3. Get the table data as a single JSON object 4. Build JSON object with multiple tables 5. Build JSON object by resolving foreign keys Conclusion PostgreSQL provides a set of built-in JSON creation functions that can be used to build basic JSON structures. This increases the performance up to 10 times more than building it at the back-end layer.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents The GitHub OAuth process Why do we need a back-end server The proxy Conclusion Recently I was building a GitHub OAuth app to authentiacate one my client-side application with GitHub. The application was all about taking notes and maintaining them on a private repository. I have had worked on such an architecture in one of my previous jobs where we have used AWS CodeCommit as an inventory of resources where the history and the changes were easier to maintain.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents Let&amp;rsquo;s go hacking Not quite there yet! Gimme the code! In this post I am going to plug about a cool trick(probably useless) that I discovered geeking around the internet.&#xA;I was building a tiny microservice which would let the client side application securely authenticate with GitHub. After writing the only required API, I wanted to render the README.md file on the index page.&#xA;So I planned to convert markdown to html and serve the resultant string everytime we hit the index.</description>

      <title>Setting up a celery task scheduler in Flask</title>

      <description>Table of Contents Let&amp;rsquo;s go hacking Monitoring events Conclusion The first thing that comes to mind when considering a task scheduler is a CRON job. As most of today&amp;rsquo;s servers are hosted on Linux machines, setting a cron job for a periodic task might seem like a good option for many. However, in production, having a crontab can be nothing but a pain. It can be tricky to configure different time zones depending on the location of the server.</description>

      <title>A floating terminal for (Neo)vim</title>

      <description>I love working in terminal and editing with (Neo)vim. Though I have been using vim since my college days, for past two years I am using it as my full-time editor.&#xA;I remember vividly when I first switched to vim at work. It was a horrible experience for the first week which made me flood my vimrc file with plugins to make it work. I have definitely moved past that phase and learned to grok vi since then.</description>

      <description>Flask is one of the most used python frameworks for web development. Its simplicity and extensibility makes it convenient for both small and large applications alike.&#xA;In this blog we are going to create a simple flask web application that will generate and serve files without storing them in the server.&#xA;Note: For flask and python installation visit flask documentation&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s create a flask application with a basic route.&#xA;from flask import Flask app = Flask(__name__) @app.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents Syntax Highlighting Linters and Formatters Autocompletion Commenting Conclusion It&amp;rsquo;s been 8 months since I have been using (neo)vim as my primary text editor. Initially it was incredibly tough to adopt and use it in work. Well that would be another story to tell.&#xA;Back then I was working mostly in backend using CoffeeScript (I know ðŸ™ˆ). VS Code had a little support for CoffeeScript so I didn&amp;rsquo;t had any problems using vim full time.</description>

      <description>I recently left a huge IT corporation for a promising startup.I was asked to change my GitHub handler name as it was too cool(I think) for them.Well instead of changing I created another account using my company email.&#xA;Now I got a problem.Every day when I come home and start hacking around my own projects I had to manually set my username and email id in git config in order to reflect my contributions in the graph and most of the time I forget to do so.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents Using Proxy with NPM For people who work in a company and squeez out some of their time to learn nodejs, setting up an dev-environment can be a real pain. Proxy servers are pretty common in college and business type institutions.&#xA;You can locate your proxy settings from your browser&amp;rsquo;s settings panel.&#xA;Using Proxy with NPM Once you have obtained the proxy settings (server URL, port, username and password); you need to configure your npm configurations as follows.</description>
