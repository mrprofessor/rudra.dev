## History {#history}

This keyboard was manufactured by [Monterey](http://www.monterey.com.tw/) in the '90s. This model came with
varieties of switches, including the Alps SKCM white and blue, SMK alps mounts,
and "alps.tw Type OA2". This particular board has Alps SKCM whites. This board
is a `Plantron` branded keyboard, and the sticker on the back says that Plantron
manufactured it. I couldn't find more details about this particular company. As
per another back sticker, this board was manufactured in April 1992.

## Build and Features {#build-and-features}

The case is made of ABS, and the keycaps are lasered(likely) thin ABS caps.

There is a grill on the top case, and it's a distinguishable feature for Monterey
K104 series keyboards. On the back, 8 screws keep the chassis together, and it's
very straightforward to open it up. There is also a button to switch between AT,
XT, and ST protocols.

## Restoration {#restoration}

The case was quite yellowed when I got it. I washed the top case with soapy
water and then retrobrighted the case with H2O2. Surprisingly the keycaps aren't
yellowed as much. I have plans to waxboil the alps switches, but for now, they
seem fine.
