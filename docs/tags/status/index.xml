      <description>Table of Contents   The good/ususal times    The pandemic    The learnings    New job    New rig    Loki    epilogue      It took me a some time to compile my thoughts down for this post. 2020 hasn&amp;rsquo;t been easy on the most and hence this won&amp;rsquo;t be a normal retrospect a year log, rather I will introspect the revelations I had during the past year.</description>

      <description>I have spend enormous time on configuring and reconfiguring my vimrc file for the past 4 years. I have been using (neo)vim at work for last 2 years and I am really happy how this has turned out. Now I am pretty confident on most of the vim key-bindings, the register management and a lot of other amazing features.
Fuck it! I am switching to Emacs.

      <description>Table of Contents   New project    New languages      Guess it&amp;rsquo;s time for a status update.
2020 huh. Well as usual I don&amp;rsquo;t have a resolution this year. My resolution deadlines are quite small and always ends with utter disappointment, so I better not mention it here.(recruiters ignore this)
 Let&amp;rsquo;s get serious!
 New project In January, I started working on a project named Solitude.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents   Python    React    Touch typing    vi    epilogue      Guess it&amp;rsquo;s time to retrospect the last 12 months.
I will be talking about topics that I have worked on or learned. These are listed in no particular order.
Python In June I switched my job and accepted a position of a back-end developer in a fairly new company with a brand new project.</description>

      <description>I have been spending so much time and energy tweaking this website, that I feel like I should maintain a log for it. No Git commit messages are not enough anymore. It&amp;rsquo;s kinda fun owning a place on the internet but at the same time it should at least mean something.
This update brings a list of logs where I will be writing more often now. Logs will be mostly unimportant and personal(Not that personal).</description>
