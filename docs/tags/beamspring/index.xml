      <description>At the time of writting, this old beamer is the prize of my collection. I have acquired this from a DT member who let it go for a fair enough price. They were kind enough to send me an metal(iron) door with the board too.&#xA;Initially, I liked the battered look of the board, but after a while, I powder coated it to black. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find an &amp;ldquo;olive-green&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;matte-black&amp;rdquo; color, So I settled for Glossy black.</description>
