## History {#history}

This keyboard is a reproduction of one of the original IBM model F 4704 series
keyboards. Originally it came with the `IBM 4704 FINANCE COMMUNICATION DISPLAY
STATION MODEL 1 ENHANCED` and mainly used by the banking industry. In 2012, it
was first documented by a Canadian computer enthusiast who goes by the name
[Kishy](http://kishy.ca/) and hence called the `Kishsaver`.

In 2015, Joe Strandberg aka `Ellipse` has decided to make [reproductions](https://deskthority.net/viewtopic.php?t=11046) of the F62
and F77 models. After a long wait of almost 4 years, in 2020 the project started
shipping the boards for the pre-orders.

Though it's a reproduction, it isn't an replica of the F 4704. It lacks a beeper,
stand, beeper volume knob, and stepped caps.


## Acquisition &amp; Details {#acquisition-details}

Like most other IBM enthusiasts, I too entered into Ellipse's group buy. But I
was too anxious to wait two years to get my hands on one, So I got this board
from r/mechmarket for a much lower price. Initially, I had planned to repaint
the keyboard to beige, but I didn't go through it. In real life, this red looks
quite beautiful.

I got the 609th model, and the sticker on the back says the date of manufacture.
It was made in China, unlike the original model.

It came with blank beige keycaps, and the seller had included a set of blank
Mopar blue keycaps. I swapped those beige caps with [Unicomp](https://www.pckeyboard.com/) APL caps with orange
sub legends, and they look pretty impressive. However, some of the switches feel
scratchier with the Unicomp cap, but I can't figure out why.

My favorite part of the keyboard is its case. The case is built with Zinc and is
pretty heavy. The powder coating on this particular model is superb, but I have
heard complaints from other buyers regarding the quality.

The board uses Model F AT-style barrels and barrel plates. The spring felt a bit
lighter than my other Model F boards, but it wasn't too different. The spacebar
uses model M type stabilizers, and it used to rattle a lot. I had to bend the
stabilizer tabs a little bit and apply some silicone grease to reduce the rattle.

The assembly backplate is heat-treated and has a rainbow effect like the IBM
Model F keyboards.

This board uses a compact version of the Xwhatsit controller([designed by wcass](https://deskthority.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=13479)),
and I was lucky enough to get the USB-C version. Ellipse made both type-C and
micro-USB controllers, and unfortunately, the buyers don't get the option to
choose. The soldering job on my model wasn't up to the mark, and I got some
unwanted key actuation. I had to clean the excess flux and tape the pins so that
they won't touch the metal case.


## Verdict {#verdict}

It is pretty rare to find boards that are built as tough as this F62 and still
offer a unique typing experience. I wouldn't recommend this board to a
non-hobbyist because of its complexities. That said, I have been daily driving
this keyboard for the past six months, and it's one of the most practical ones
in my collection.
