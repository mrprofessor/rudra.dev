      <description>Table of Contents   General configuration    Keybindings    Customize Status Bar    Customize Active Pane    Miscellaneous    Who wants a minimal config anyway!      General configuration We need to create a ~/.tmux.conf file in our home directory. This will be the configuration file for our setup.
If the underlying terminal emulator has XTERM-256 support then we can add 256 colors support to tmux.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents   The GitHub OAuth process    Why do we need a back-end server    The proxy    Conclusion      Recently I was building a GitHub OAuth app to authentiacate one my client-side application with GitHub. The application was all about taking notes and maintaining them on a private repository. I have had worked on such an architecture in one of my previous jobs where we have used AWS CodeCommit  as an inventory of resources where the history and the changes were easier to maintain.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents   Let&amp;rsquo;s go hacking    Not quite there yet!    Gimme the code!      In this post I am going to plug about a cool trick(probably useless) that I discovered geeking around the internet.
I was building a tiny microservice  which would let the client side application securely authenticate with GitHub. After writing the only required API, I wanted to render the README.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents   Let&amp;rsquo;s go hacking    Monitoring events    Conclusion      The first thing that comes to mind while considering a task scheduler is a cron job. As most of the today&amp;rsquo;s servers are hosted on linux machines, setting a cron job for periodic task might seem like a good option for many. However in production having a crontab is nothing but a pain in the a**.</description>

      <description>I love working in terminal and editing with (Neo)vim  . Though I have been using vim since my college days, for past two years I am using it as my full-time editor.
I remember vividly when I first switched to vim at work. It was a horrible experience for the first week which made me flood my vimrc file with plugins to make it work. I have definitely moved past that phase and learned to grok  vi since then.</description>

      <description>Flask is one of the most used python frameworks for web development. Its simplicity and extensibility makes it convenient for both small and large applications alike.
In this blog we are going to create a simple flask web application that will generate and serve files without storing them in the server.
 Note: For flask and python installation visit flask documentation   Let&amp;rsquo;s create a flask application with a basic route.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents   Syntax Highlighting    Linters and Formatters    Autocompletion    Commenting    Conclusion      It&amp;rsquo;s been 8 months since I have been using (neo)vim as my primary text editor. Initially it was incredibly tough to adopt and use it in work. Well that would be another story to tell.
Back then I was working mostly in backend using CoffeeScript  (I know 🙈).</description>

      <description>I recently left a huge IT corporation for a promising startup.I was asked to change my GitHub handler name as it was too cool(I think) for them.Well instead of changing I created another account using my company email.
Now I got a problem.Every day when I come home and start hacking around my own projects I had to manually set my username and email id in git config in order to reflect my contributions in the graph and most of the time I forget to do so.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents   Using Proxy with NPM      For people who work in a company and squeez out some of their time to learn nodejs, setting up an dev-environment can be a real pain. Proxy servers are pretty common in college and business type institutions.
You can locate your proxy settings from your browser&amp;rsquo;s settings panel.
Using Proxy with NPM Once you have obtained the proxy settings (server URL, port, username and password); you need to configure your npm configurations as follows.</description>
