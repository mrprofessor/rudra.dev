This is another attempt to log whatever I am up to nowadays. I am quite bad at
keeping a daily diary, so this logs page was supposed to keep an update on my
works. However, after 2 years I believe I have utterly failed to keep doing that.


## Games {#games}

I have mentioned on my last log that I have built a nice enough gaming rig and
have been playing a lot of Rust. I have stopped doing that since last March and
started playing RDR2. Red dead redemption 2, after 3 years of its release is
still an absolutely mesmerizing game at the core.

I have retired my aging Samsung S8 after 3 years of usage and got a cheaper
Oneplus 9R. Played some `Genshin Impact` on that for months, and that is an
amazing game too.


## Keyboards {#keyboards}

I have had 3-4 mechanical keyboards until the start of this year. Then I got
introduced to the world of vintage keyboards this summer and now I own more
than 10s of these.

After having a almost respectable collection, it's only obvious that I would
dedicate a page in my site for all those beautiful keyboards. It won't be a
review page, just all the information that I can muster about these boards.

Until now my most prized collections inclue one IBM 3278 beamspring keyboard,
IBM Model F 3178, IBM Model F AT, Model F XT, various Model M's. I have also
managed to get some boards with alps swithchs, e.g Northgate Omnikey ultra,
Dell AT101W, a couple of Apple M0115s. The list also includes some NEC blue
ovals(APC 412) too.


## New projects {#new-projects}

No new projects for now, been planning to read/complete some books e.g `let's go`
by Alex Edwards and `Writing An Interpreter In Go` by Thorsten Ball. However, once
done I would like to replicate it in `Rust`.


## Self host everything {#self-host-everything}

I have recently got 200$/mo cloud credits from my current Employer, and I have
been really impressed by the capabilities of `NextCloud` and hopefully I will get
enough time to set up my own file storage. Should be a fun project IMO.

Alrighty! This will keep me busy for now.
