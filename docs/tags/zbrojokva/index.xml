      <description>This board was manufactured by a Czechoslovakian company called Zbrojovka Brno in the late &amp;rsquo;80s. Zbrojovka Brno manufactured small arms, motor vehicles, and later typewriters and computers.&#xA;I have documented another Zbrojokva board, and it&amp;rsquo;s very similar to that one.&#xA;Zbrojovka Brno 262.4 back Acquisition My good friend krikun98, helped me buy and ship a few Soviet-era boards along with this one. This board is in NOS condition, So I didn&amp;rsquo;t open it up to take some pictures.</description>
