I build expansive and scalable web applications at work. I aspire to create
tiny and useful applications at home.

If your idea captures my interest, I am willing to dedicate a few hours each
week to software consulting. You can even hire me full-time if you are
shipping applications with a [Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html) license.

If you need any help regarding any of my articles, Please drop a comment
and/or send me an email at contact[at]rudra.dev.
