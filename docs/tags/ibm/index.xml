      <description>History IBM 4704 administrative keyboard a.k.a the Pingmaster is one of the most iconic vintage keyboards out there. After chasing it for over a year, I finally managed to acquire one.&#xA;IBM Pingmaster numpad The earliest appearance of the board was around 1983. In western markets, the IBM 4704 terminal came bundled with a 107-key Capacitive buckling spring keyboard. In Asian markets, it used to be sold with an Alps corporation-made keyboard with Chinese or Japanese legends.</description>

      <description>History This keyboard originally came with IBM Personal Computer AT (PC/AT). This computer was released in 1984, and IBM has produced over 100,000 units before discontinuing them in 1987. Some sources say that the AT stands for Advanced Technology.&#xA;IBM Model F AT key units This model was a successor to the very famous and now weird XT layout. The IBM PS/2 (Personal System/2) was the successor to the IBM PC/AT, and with it came the venerable model M keyboard.</description>

      <description>At the time of writting, this old beamer is the prize of my collection. I have acquired this from a DT member who let it go for a fair enough price. They were kind enough to send me an metal(iron) door with the board too.&#xA;Initially, I liked the battered look of the board, but after a while, I powder coated it to black. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find an &amp;ldquo;olive-green&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;matte-black&amp;rdquo; color, So I settled for Glossy black.</description>

      <description>This is the first vintage keyboard I have acquired. Unfortunately, it was broken into pieces on its way to me from Florida. However, with a bit of tender love and care, it was up and running in a few hours.&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t know the exact manufacturing date of the board, but there is a sticker that says it was repaired in 1989. Most IBM 5150 keyboards were manufactured before 1984, So it is at least 37 years old in 2021.</description>

      <description>History This keyboard is a reproduction of one of the original IBM model F 4704 series keyboards. Originally it came with the IBM 4704 FINANCE COMMUNICATION DISPLAY STATION MODEL 1 ENHANCED and mainly used by the banking industry. In 2012, it was first documented by a Canadian computer enthusiast who goes by the name Kishy and hence called the Kishsaver.&#xA;In 2015, Joe Strandberg aka Ellipse has decided to make reproductions of the F62 and F77 models.</description>
