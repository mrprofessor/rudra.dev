At the time of writting, this old beamer is the prize of my collection. I have
acquired this from a DT member who let it go for a fair enough price. They were
kind enough to send me an metal(iron) door with the board too.

Initially, I liked the battered look of the board, but after a while, I powder
coated it to black. I couldn't find an "olive-green" or "matte-black" color,
So I settled for Glossy black. It looked quite good in person but shines a lot
on camera.

The board wasn't in a terrible condition when I got it. The foam had turned
into sticky goo, which needed some cleaning up. I manually cut a craft store
foam and replaced it.

I got [Pandrew's version of the Xwhatsit controller](https://github.com/purdeaandrei/CompactBeamSpring) to replace the original
controller. I got Pandrew's solenoid driver too, and after a bit of hacking
around with QMK, I got it working.

There are some corrosions on the plate but I was told that they won't grow, so
I didn't bother. There was a bit of rust on the switch springs, so I tried to
take apart the switches to clean them but found them hard to disassemble and
ultimately gave up. The rust doesn't affect the smoothness of the switches.

I used the board for a week as my daily driver with the solenoid on. I wasn't
very impressed with the heavy space bar as it tired my thumb after every 15
minutes. Apart from that, this board is an absolute joy to have and is
a thing of beauty.

I love this board, and hopefully, it will be on my secondary machine for years
to come, but right now, I will get back to my beloved [F AT](/keyboards/ibm_model_f_at/) and get some work
done.
