      <description>History This keyboard originally came with IBM Personal Computer AT (PC/AT). This computer was released in 1984, and IBM has produced over 100,000 units before discontinuing them in 1987. Some sources say that the AT stands for Advanced Technology.&#xA;IBM Model F AT key units This model was a successor to the very famous and now weird XT layout. The IBM PS/2 (Personal System/2) was the successor to the IBM PC/AT, and with it came the venerable model M keyboard.</description>

      <description>This is the first vintage keyboard I have acquired. Unfortunately, it was broken into pieces on its way to me from Florida. However, with a bit of tender love and care, it was up and running in a few hours.&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t know the exact manufacturing date of the board, but there is a sticker that says it was repaired in 1989. Most IBM 5150 keyboards were manufactured before 1984, So it is at least 37 years old in 2021.</description>

      <description>History This keyboard is a reproduction of one of the original IBM model F 4704 series keyboards. Originally it came with the IBM 4704 FINANCE COMMUNICATION DISPLAY STATION MODEL 1 ENHANCED and mainly used by the banking industry. In 2012, it was first documented by a Canadian computer enthusiast who goes by the name Kishy and hence called the Kishsaver.&#xA;In 2015, Joe Strandberg aka Ellipse has decided to make reproductions of the F62 and F77 models.</description>
