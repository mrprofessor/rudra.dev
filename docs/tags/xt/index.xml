      <description>This is the first vintage keyboard I have acquired. Unfortunately, it was broken into pieces on its way to me from Florida. However, with a bit of tender love and care, it was up and running in a few hours.&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t know the exact manufacturing date of the board, but there is a sticker that says it was repaired in 1989. Most IBM 5150 keyboards were manufactured before 1984, So it is at least 37 years old in 2021.</description>
