I build expansive and scalable web applications at work. At home, I
aspire to create tiny, useful applications â€“ the kind that don't
require a second mortgage to host.

If your idea captures my interest, or you are offering compensation
that makes my current salary look like a rounding error, I am willing
to dedicate a few hours a week to software consulting. Full time?
Sure, see previous point about rounding errors.

Got questions about my articles? Found a bug in my code snippets? Or
maybe you just want to debate vim vs emacs? Drop a comment or shoot me
an email at contact[at]rudra.dev. I read everything, even the spam.
