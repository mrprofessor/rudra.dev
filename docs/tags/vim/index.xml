      <description>I love working in terminal and editing with (Neo)vim. Though I have been using vim since my college days, for past two years I am using it as my full-time editor.&#xA;I remember vividly when I first switched to vim at work. It was a horrible experience for the first week which made me flood my vimrc file with plugins to make it work. I have definitely moved past that phase and learned to grok vi since then.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents Syntax Highlighting Linters and Formatters Autocompletion Commenting Conclusion It&amp;rsquo;s been 8 months since I have been using (neo)vim as my primary text editor. Initially it was incredibly tough to adopt and use it in work. Well that would be another story to tell.&#xA;Back then I was working mostly in backend using CoffeeScript (I know ðŸ™ˆ). VS Code had a little support for CoffeeScript so I didn&amp;rsquo;t had any problems using vim full time.</description>
