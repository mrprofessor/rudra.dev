      <description>History This keyboard was manufactured by Monterey in the &amp;rsquo;90s. This model came with varieties of switches, including the Alps SKCM white and blue, SMK alps mounts, and &amp;ldquo;alps.tw Type OA2&amp;rdquo;. This particular board has Alps SKCM whites. This board is a Plantron branded keyboard, and the sticker on the back says that Plantron manufactured it. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find more details about this particular company. As per another back sticker, this board was manufactured in April 1992.</description>
