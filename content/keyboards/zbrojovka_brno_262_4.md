This board was manufactured by a Czechoslovakian company called [Zbrojovka Brno](http://www.zbrojovka-brno.cz/)
in the late '80s. Zbrojovka Brno manufactured small arms, motor vehicles, and
later typewriters and computers.

I have documented another [Zbrojokva board,](/keyboards/zbrojovka_brno_262_5/) and it's very similar to that one.

## Acquisition {#acquisition}

My good friend [krikun98](https://www.youtube.com/user/krikun998), helped me buy and ship a few Soviet-era boards along
with this one. This board is in NOS condition, So I didn't open it up to take
some pictures.

The switches and keycaps are in excellent condition. The board even came with
styrofoam, and I believe it is the original one. It doesn't need any
restoration; however, I need to make a converter for modern systems.
