## History {#history}

Apple manufactured this board in the late '80s and early 90s. This board was the
successor of the venerable Apple Extended Keyboard. These boards were included
with Apple professional desktops starting with the [Macintosh IIsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_IIsi).

These boards use either Alps or Mitsumi switches. The Mitsumi switches were only
used on boards made in Japan. M3501s are said to be the last
"Mechanical Keyboards" that apple has ever made.

## Build and features {#build-and-features}

I got this German layout M3501 from the Deskthority sale listing for a fair price.

It has thick PBT dye-sublimated keycaps with `Univers 57 Oblique` font, and It uses
the Alps dampened cream switches. However, the spacebar is made of ABS and hence
it's yellowed.

The case is also made of ABS, and it had been significantly yellowed when I
acquired it. The case design is wavy, and I found it quite ergonomic without the
feet extended.

It features an Apple rainbow logo, and unlike the `AEK I`, the logo is at the top.

The `Caps Lock` uses an Alps latching switch, which physically locks down when
activated.

The Apple M3501 features an innovative yet weird feet design. The feet consist
of a plastic plate instead of two separate ones. There is a scrollbar on the back
to extend and retract the feet.

This particular board has [Alps SKCM Cream Dampened](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Alps_SKCM_Cream_Damped) switches, which are the most
common switches found on AEK IIs. The switches are stacked vertically on the
function row, which is kind of unique to the AEK series boards.

## Restoration {#restoration}

To be honest, It didn't require a lot of restoring,  I have only `retrobrighted`
the case with `H2O2` and got rid of the excess yellowing. That said, I have plans
to `wax-boil` the switches and clean the keycaps too. This keyboard didn't come
with a cable either, I need to procure one.
